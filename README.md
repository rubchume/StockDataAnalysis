This project explores stock data forecasting and trading strategies that make use of that forecast.

The intent is not to create some production ready trading strategy, but to showcase some popular time series statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMAX, Simple Exponential Smoothing), how to train them, and how to use the forecasts in real strategies using the Backtrader library. I have also made use of technical analysis tools like Bollinger Bands.
